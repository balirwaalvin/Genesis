## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "fatal: Authentication failed"
- Your token might be incorrect
- Generate a new one: https://github.com/settings/tokens
- Make sure `repo` scope is selected
- Try again with the new token

### "Repository not found"
- Check the URL: https://github.com/balirwaalvin/Genesis
- Verify the repository exists on GitHub
- Make sure you're using the correct username

### "Already exists" error
- Try this instead: `git push origin main` (without the `-u`)

### Nothing is happening
- Make sure you're in the right directory: `C:\Users\EduScan\WebstormProjects\Genesis`
- Check your internet connection
- Try: `git status` to verify the setup
